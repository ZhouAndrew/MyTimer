# Task 8B: Local Sound Server for Timer Ringing

## Objective
Implement a minimal local HTTP server that plays sounds when triggered.

## Features
- [ ] `POST /ring` – Play alarm sound
- [ ] `GET /test` – Play test sound
- [ ] `POST /mute` – Toggle mute state
- [ ] `GET /state` – Return current mute and playback status

## Implementation Notes
- Use Python (`FastAPI` or `Flask`)
- Use one of:
  - `playsound`
  - `pygame`
  - `subprocess.run(["aplay", "alarm.wav"])`
- Run on `localhost:8800`
- Must be fast and lightweight

## Suggested File
- `sound_server/sound_server.py`
