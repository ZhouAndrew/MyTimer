# Task 5: Enable Full TUI Control (Timer CRUD)

## Goal
Allow users to create, start, pause, resume, and delete timers entirely from within the TUI interface.

## Checklist

- [ ] Add `[c]` key handler in TUI to prompt for new timer duration and optional tag.
- [ ] Add `[s]` shortcut to manually start a newly created timer.
- [ ] Add confirmation dialog for `[d]` delete action.
- [ ] Ensure `p` (pause) and `r` (resume) work properly with new timers created from TUI.
- [ ] Display keyboard hint bar with full control list: `j/k/c/s/p/r/d/q`.
- [ ] Write integration test for the full lifecycle (create → start → pause → resume → delete).
