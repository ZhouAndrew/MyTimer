# Task 6: Timestamp-Based Timer Logic & Local Mode

## Goal
Switch to timestamp-based timer computation and enable offline/local mode for TUI clients.

## Checklist

### Timestamp-Based Logic

- [ ] Modify timer model to store:
  - [ ] `created_at` (timestamp when the timer was created)
  - [ ] `start_at` (null or timestamp when started)
  - [ ] `duration` in seconds
- [ ] Compute `remaining` and `finished` status on client side using:
  ```python
  remaining = max(0, duration - (now - start_at)) if running
  ```
- [ ] Update server WebSocket broadcast logic to send minimal changes (state transitions only).
- [ ] Update CLI/TUI to derive current state from timestamps.

### Local Mode (Client-Side)

- [ ] On TUI startup, try to connect to server:
  - [ ] If fails, enter local/offline mode
- [ ] Implement client-side persistence: store timers in `timers.json`
- [ ] Support create/start/pause/resume/delete actions locally
- [ ] Add reconnect logic: when server is reachable again, show sync prompt
- [ ] Add tests for local mode logic and persistence
