# âœ… Task 6 Completion

All items in `todo/task6_20250724_054841.md` have been implemented. Timers now use timestamp-based fields (`created_at`, `start_at`), remaining time is computed client-side and WebSocket updates include only state changes. The TUI automatically switches to a local mode when the server is unreachable, storing timers in `~/.timercli/timers.json` until reconnection.
